## [hoodie-plugin-store-crypto](https://github.com/Terreii/hoodie-plugin-store-crypto)

*A plugin for [Hoodie](http://hood.ie/) that adds methods to add, read, update and delete encrypted documents and enable end-to-end encryption.*

I used this package to learn test-driven-development and maintaining a package, that is [published on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hoodie-plugin-store-crypto). It was originally intended to be only a part of the [Andromeda-Viewer](#andromeda-viewer), but I quickly recognized that it would be of good use for others.

## [Andromeda-Viewer](https://github.com/Terreii/andromeda-viewer/)

*Small web-client for connecting to the virtual worlds of [Second Life](https://secondlife.com/) and [OpenSimulator](http://opensimulator.org/).*

This is my project where I can grow all my talents!
- it must work with a third-party service, over both UDP and HTTP, using not documented protocols.
- it needs a server.
- it must run on mobile and desktop.
- it must be 100% accessible.

## [Schichtkalender (shift-calendar)](https://schichtkalender-rt.now.sh/)

*A unofficial shift-calendar for Bosch in Reutlingen.*

The [original version](https://github.com/Terreii/shift-calendar-rt/tree/gh-pages) is one of my oldest projects. But I realized, that it would be easier to re-write it than update it.

With the new version I focused almost exclusively a mobile experience. With a release size of 459kb (122,7kb without icons) I might have succeeded.

It is a [PWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_applications) and would pass as [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/), but without a API-backend. At the moment it is *only in German* (because it is a utility app for my work).

## Design

Over the years I also done designs for web-sites.
