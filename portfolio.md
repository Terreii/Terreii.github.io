## [hoodie-plugin-store-crypto](https://github.com/Terreii/hoodie-plugin-store-crypto)

*A plugin for [Hoodie](http://hood.ie/) that adds methods to add, read, update and delete encrypted documents and enable end-to-end encryption.*

I used this package to learn test-driven-development and maintaining a package, that is [published on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hoodie-plugin-store-crypto). It was originally intended to be only a part of an other project of mine ([Andromeda-Viewer](#andromeda-viewer)), but I quickly recognized that it would be of good use for others.

[More can be read in my blog-post about it]({% post_url 2019-05-17-publishing-my-hoodie-plugin %}).

## [Andromeda-Viewer](https://github.com/Terreii/andromeda-viewer/)

*Small web-client for connecting to the virtual worlds of [Second Life](https://secondlife.com/) and [OpenSimulator](http://opensimulator.org/).*

This is my project where I can grow all my talents!
- it must work with a third-party service, over both UDP and HTTP, using not documented protocols.
- it needs a server.
- it must run on mobile and desktop.
- it must be 100% accessible.

## [Schichtkalender (shift-calendar)](https://schichtkalender-rt.now.sh/)

*A unofficial shift-calendar for Bosch in Reutlingen.*

The [original version](https://github.com/Terreii/shift-calendar-rt/tree/gh-pages) is one of my oldest projects. But I realized, that it would be easier to re-write it than update it.

With the new version I focused almost exclusively a mobile experience. With a release size of 459kb (the bundle with 94,51kb) I'm on a good way.

It is a [PWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_applications) and would pass as [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/), but without a API-backend. At the moment it is *only in German* (because it is a utility app for my work). With it I learned a lot about making a web-app accessible for people with little to almost no computer knowledge.

## open source

I also contribute some patches to open source projects:

- [hoodiehq / pouchdb-users](https://github.com/hoodiehq/pouchdb-users/pull/10)
- [hoodiehq / hoodie-store-client](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-store-client/issues/168)

## Design

Over the years I also helped to design and implement the CSS for web-sites.

My first page-design was of my scout-groups page [dpsg-eningen.de](http://dpsg-eningen.de/).

[![dpsg-eningen.de](/assets/dpsg-eningen.jpg)](http://dpsg-eningen.de/)

Later I lead the team that designed [IronScout2018.de](https://www.ironscout2018.de/).
